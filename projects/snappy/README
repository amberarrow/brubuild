These files build the snappy compression library. Get the source archive from
http://code.google.com/p/snappy/ and unpack it somewhere.

Start the build like this (where <src-dir> is the full path to the directory where
you unpacked the snappy source archive):

  ruby -w snappy.rb -s <src-dir> -o /var/tmp/brubuild/snappy -b rel

After it finishes, you should find the snappy library 'libsnappy.1.1.3.so_rel' and the
the executable for running unit tests 'snappy_unittest.rel_d' under
/var/tmp/brubuild/snappy/{lib,bin}. The executable needs to be run from the snappy source
directory since it needs some data from there.

NOTES:
=====
1. Use the -h (or --help) option to see a summary of available options.

2. The -o option specifies the destination directory where all object files will be
   placed; the source directory will not be modified in any way.

3. The version number needs to be explicitly specified with the -v option.

4. The -b option specified the build type: 'rel' denotes a release build so the compiles
   will be optimized, asserts disabled and the binaries stripped.

5. The 'configure' script in the snappy distribution creates a config.h file based which
   header files are present; currently, brubuild does not have this capability (though it
   is easy to add) so we simulate this behavior with pre-built config.h files for major
   platforms (e.g. Linux, OSX/Darwin).

6. There is currently no analogue of "make install"; we hope to provide equivalent
   functionality in the future but for now we suggest using a small custom script to
   copy appropriate binaries from the object directory to where they need to be installed.
