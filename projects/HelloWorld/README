These files build the HelloWorld sample project that ships as part of the Rubuild
sources.

Start the build like this:

ruby -w hello_world.rb -s $PWD/../../HelloWorld -o /var/tmp/brubuild/HelloWorld -b rel

You should see output like this:

Discovering dependencies ... done
0 targets remain
Shutting down thread pool ...
Build finished

At this point, you can examine /var/tmp/brubuild/HelloWorld/bin to verify that it has a
binary named "hello.rel_d". Now, run the binary with an integer argument:
    /var/tmp/brubuild/HelloWorld/bin/hello.rel_d 3

You should see the following output:

Hello Mars

A brief help message listing available options is displayed with:
    ruby -w hello_world.rb -h

NOTES:
=====
1. Use the -h (or --help) option to see a summary of available options.

2. The -o option specifies the destination directory where all object files will be
   placed; the source directory will not be modified in any way.

3. The version number is optional and is specified with the -v option.

4. The -b option specifies the build type: 'rel' denotes a release build so the compiles
   will be optimized, asserts disabled and the binaries stripped.

5. There is currently no analogue of "make install"; we hope to provide equivalent
   functionality in the future but for now we suggest using a small custom script to
   copy appropriate binaries from the object directory to where they need to be installed.
