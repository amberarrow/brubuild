These files build the tokyocabinet database. Get the source archive from
http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/tokyocabinet-1.4.47.tar.gz and unpack it somewhere.

Start the build like this (where <src-dir> is the full path to the directory where
you unpacked the source archive):

ruby -w tc.rb -s <src-dir> -o /var/tmp/brubuild/tokyocabinet -v 1.4.47 -b rel

After it finishes, you should find the library 'libtokyocabinet.1.4.47.so_rel'
and a number of executables under /var/tmp/brubuild/tokyocabinet/{lib,bin}.

NOTES:
=====
1. Use the -h (or --help) option to see a summary of available options.

2. The -o option specifies the destination directory where all object files will be
   placed; the source directory will not be modified in any way.

3. The version number needs to be explicitly specified with the -v option.

4. The -b option specified the build type: 'rel' denotes a release build so the compiles
   will be optimized, asserts disabled and the binaries stripped.

5. There is currently no analogue of "make install"; we hope to provide equivalent
   functionality in the future but for now we suggest using a small custom script to
   copy appropriate binaries from the object directory to where they need to be installed.
